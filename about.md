## Daniel Lawson

I've been a computer geek since I was old enough to type.  I scavenged my first 8088 out of the trash, and rocked a sweet 8 color EGA monitor. (I know it was supposed to be 16, but this damn thing only did 8).  

I'm always looking to learn new things infosec wise, and I love dissecting things to find out what makes them tick.
