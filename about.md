## Daniel Lawson

Iâ€™ve been a computer geek since I was old enough to type.  I scavenged my first 8088 out of the trash, and rocked a sweet 8 color EGA monitor. (I know it was supposed to be 16, but this damn thing only did 8).

I've spent over a decade as a sysadmin, and have since moved over into information security full time, working as a full time pentester.
